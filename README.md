# SolarSystemRefFrames

This project aims at gathering Solar System reference frames in use by the 
science community. This task is a conducted under the 
[IVOA/SSIG](http://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IvoaSS) (Solar System 
Interest Group of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance), the 
[IPDA](http://planetarydata.org) (International Planetary Data Alliance) 
and the [EPN2020RI/VESPA](http://europlanet-vespa.eu) (Virtual European
Solar and Planetary Access workpackage of the Europlanet-H2020-RI project).

The work plan of this project is as follows:
* Listing of reference frames in use from major sources, such as planetary, 
space physics and solar data archives, reference papers, community tools, 
etc.
* Merging the lists, identifying synonyms and possible relation and/or 
classification between frames.
* Submitting the lists to IVOA and IPDA for review.
